The new facility will have an egg-set capacity of 2.5 million eggs per week, according to the company.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Our &lsquo;No Antibiotic Ever&rsquo; policy requires us to provide the healthiest start possible to each and every bird, and this new facility &ndash; the most technologically-advanced hatchery on Delmarva &ndash; will deliver that,&rdquo; said President and CEO Joe Moran. &ldquo;It will be also be more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The new 70,000-square-foot facility will be built on the company&rsquo;s 19.84-acre site on Nine Foot Road in Dagsboro, according to the company. Allen Harim also noted the Sussex County Council recently approved tying into the county&rsquo;s sewer and water infrastructure, which will alleviate the need for on-site spray irrigation.</p><p>When complete, the company will close two older hatcheries, one in Seaford and one in Dagsboro, and employees at both locations will be offered opportunities at the new hatchery or at other Allen Harim facilities, company officials&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p><p>Headquartered in Seaford, Del., Allen Harim operates a chicken processing facility in Harbeson, Del.; a breeding operation in Liberty, N.C.; a hatchery in Dagsboro, Del., and a hatchery and feed mill in Seaford.
